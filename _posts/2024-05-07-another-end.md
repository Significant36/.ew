I'd like to preface this entry with ~~a word from our sponsor~~ a quick thought on "living". Once again, it's May, the end of the school year, the beginning of summer adventures, and just another month in the limited time we have to "live". It's such a platitude but 

### Time really does move fast

All of this year has gone by. The truth is, I feel like I wasted some of it (as always). With college admissions peering around the corner, I should probably start focusing.

- **October - December**: Suddenly commotion broke, school began ramping up, the math competition scene kicked into high gear, and of course, midterms. 
- **January - February**: Lots of Lincoln Douglas debate, some more competitions, a trip to France and Switzerland; calm before the storm.

### AP Exams

Today, May 7th, is my first exam: AP Statistics. Statistics has always came easy to me, and I hope I can walk away from the gym today with a 5. Here's a list, 
- **AP Stats**
\
Today, May 7th, Confidence: 97%. 

- **AP CSA**
\
Tomorrow, May 8th, Confidence: 94%. Self studied this one and I think OOP makes 10000% more sense to me now as a traditionally C++ programmer. College Board does love small, technical, (~~abusive~~) multiple choice questions and easy free responses though. 

- **AP Calc AB**
\ 
My birthday, May 13th, Confidence: 99%. I mean it's math it's pretty obvious I like math. See you on the other end of the tunnel.
