So somestuff happened. A lot of lasts and beginnings. Let's recap.

### Flute Recital

For some context, I've played the flute since middle school. Although I was... half-decent at it, I never really found my "thing" for it ever since 8th grad ended. I quit band last year because the truth is, it was a waste of time. As of a week ago, I was first chair in my local Orchestra and an All-State qualifier but I left all that behind Saturday. For those who were wondering, I played [the theme from Schindler's List](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcEeeVoFVDQ&themeRefresh=1) (just someone's cover) instead of a traditional piece. It's just another thing I feel like I'm throwing away to be forgotten in hidden file cabinet in my brain. If I ever find a way to create time, I'll play another piece. 

### AP Exams

So, they went well! Nothing too crazy happened apart from me messing up an integral on a free response and forgetting dynamic type vs declared type in Java. Early predictions make me look like a narcissist. 

### School

Technically, I have no more classes, only 1 more week of final exams. With regard to those, they should be pretty easy (I only have 4) and I probably won't study. It's weird knowing that I'm 3 months away from being an upperclassman and will be driving to school. Oh yeah! I'm gonna try to get my license soon and I also secured a parking spot for next year! 

### Music

I might include a *Music* section in each entry from now on just to show what I'm listening to during that time. 

Excellent solo, 8.75/10.

Another installment in the Drake v. KDot beef, 7.7/10.

Also, while I was studying for my French speaking exam, I discovered this little gem, 8.3/10. (maybe a bit stereotypical though)

### Movie

As you might know from my about page, I love watching movies. I might try to also include a *Movie* section in each entry from now on, or I might figure out a way to make another section separate from my posts dedicated for them. Anywho, I watched a couple this week, but most notably,

   1. American Beauty
   - Woah, loved this from an analytical watching perspective. Although the plot was maybe boring at times, the climax was well conducted and I have to say, Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) does an amazing job acting. Good Fellas also did not disappoint. 8.24/10

   2. La Haine 
   - So for my AP French summer work, I have to watch a french speaking movie and I decided to get that done fast. I chose La Haine, a 24hr snapshot of a group of friends in the slums of France, angry at the police for the hospitalization of their friend. I think the plot was dull at times but the periscope into French culture illuminated my curiosity. Accidental death at the end does make for a rather lazy ending though, much like the "it was all a dream" trope. Not bad though, 7.05/10.
