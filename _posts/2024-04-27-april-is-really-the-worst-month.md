### The Waste Land

T.S. Eliot is right
> April *is* [indeed] the cruellest month...

It's worse than the pre-exam, AMC 10/12, peak football season, lots of homework November and definitely worse than the AIME, camp application, first-unit-back test week in transition from January to February. Why? 

### Rejection

No, I did not ask a girl out. I applied to some programs for fun and... didn't get in any. It's the weirdest thing. Super weird. Disappointingly weird. Rejection evokes this mysterious wave of indescribable emotion... andddd I'm not sure what to do. I might go over each rejection in-depth in a future blog post but for now, I've realized a few things[^1].
- **It's freeing**
\
and it feels good. It's quite literally freeing in that my family can *finally* plan our vacation back to the motherland and I'm guaranteed to see my extended family :). Also, a certain Mr. Taylor would be very happy to know I'm available to attend Mu Alpha Theta Nationals again (and hopefully beat Buchholz again). This way, I've made my teacher, my friends, and a little bit of myself happier. But the one question that haunts me is 
>Would **I** have been happier with an acceptance? 
Or if there was some numerical measurement of happiness, 
>Would the total gain in happiness be more with a rejection?

- **Perhaps this is what life wants me to do**
\
but idk. I would go on a lengthy dive into what "life" means and if destiny is real to me but that'll wait. In short, I view life as 3 phases,

  1. Everything seems to be okay. 
  2. Everything just seems to be existing.
  3. Everything seems to **not** be okay.

Hopefully, the rollercoaster theory from Kindergarten is indeed right and after this exhilaratingly scary tumble down, things will look up. 
  
[1^]: Or maybe I'm just coping; nobody will ever know, not even myself.
