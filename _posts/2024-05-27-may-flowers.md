The saying goes, 
> April showers bring May flowers.

Obviously, [april showers](/2024/04/27/april-is-really-the-worst-month/)
exist but what are my May flowers? If I had to guess, they would be the following,

### A surreal, scary, stupendously satisfying end. 
School is over. Orchestra is over. Debate is over. Early mornings goofing off in Math Team is over (temporarily). Luckily, there's a lot of fun; a short list looks like:
- ARML (American Regional Math League)
- MAO Nationals (Mu Alpha Theta)
- Vacation out of the country ðŸ‘€
- Random sleepover with friends

### Music
If my life were a system of equations, the music would be the only constant variable. Listening to music makes me bigger than life, stronger than King Kong, weaker than Christian Bale in *The Machinist*, as confident as Patrick Bateman, and as sad as the last day of school. Music is my eternal blossom. This week, I listened to

- Oh my fire. Absolute heat. 50 Cent and Bas absolutely killed their features and the song feels like *Empire State of Mind* upgraded. This might be one of his best. 9.5/10

- Fifa 14. Suits intro. Just Dance '15. Pure nostalgia and I love it.  8.6/10


### Movies
Movies are just the manifestation of Music into viewable form. 
This week, I watched a good amount and here are my takes. (Sorted from least liked to most liked)

   1. Waves
   - Recommended by my friend **AS** to watch on Netflix. Depicting a tragic death of a brother's girlfriend and his incarceration, the main character finds peace in her life as she tries to hold her family together. It's is certainly underrated, but could be made so much better if they
     - Didn't spend 50% of the film in the expositions
     - Spent more time on the meaningful message in the end
   Regardless, good movie. 7.5/10

   2. One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest
   - Absolute class from Jack Nicholson. However, throughout the movie, I couldn't tell if the movie was a comedy or a serious depiction of mental illness. The ending was hilarious but also incredibly eye-opening and my favorite character might be Chief. Exellent acting by Nurse Ratchet though. 8.4/10

   3. Falling down
   - Holy shit, this was a fucking banger. All expectations of a so-called *American Classic* were filled and I honestly think this falls in my top 10 (I should probably post about that sometime). Michael Douglas completly embodies the casual disenfranchised American frustrated with how society has changed and it was super cool to see a pseudo-modern problem captured in the film. The world simply isn't fair and maybe like William 'D-Fens' Foster, some of us believe we're doing the right thing but everyone else thinks we've become the bad guy. It was a sad ending, but I loved it. 9.2/10
